The files here are for maintaining a list of bugs
fixed so html and xml can be posted to prevanders.net
and CVE (see cert.org) issues can reference a public
database.

This is intended mainly for bugs  that can result in
application crashes as such can represent a vulnerability
that can be exploited.
Bugs that result simply in errors in output (but no crash)
will typically not be mentioned.

Bugs in dwarfdump are not vulnerabilities in the same way
and at present these do not get CVE identifiers.
